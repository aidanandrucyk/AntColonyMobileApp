    <string name="bite_description_good">After several sun cycles of battle, both sides incurred grave losses. To verbally express it was a tug of war would be an understatement. It was only in the final push that it became pellucid that our Queen’s colony were the victors of such an engagement. Battles of such heated natures shall bring glory to our queendom!</string>
    <string name="bite_description_bad">Outnumbered and outmaneuvered, our noble ants have been truncated to meager numbers. Those noble souls may be lost but they are not forgotten. Anon we shall exact our vengeance upon the mound of innoble ants!</string>

    <string name="how_to_play_description">There are five major game player interactions: \n \n
        Clicking on the queen: increases idle and total ants by strength factor at no cost \n \n
        Grow: increases the colony strength at the cost of idle ants \n \n
        Lift: large increase of idle and total ants at the cost of strength with 50% success rate \n \n
        Bite: risky huge change in idle/total ants and territories owned with success rate contingent on number of idle and total ants and random chance. \n \n
        Upgrade Colony: increases strength, colony tier, glory score, and colony aesthetics requiring (but not costing) territories claimed and number of grows. \n
